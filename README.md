# absence_manager

A Flutter application to manage and display employee absences. It includes features like listing absences with pagination, filtering by type and date, and displaying absence details such as member name, absence type, period, and status. The app supports loading and error states, as well as an empty state when no results are found. Optionally, the app can generate an iCal file for integration with Outlook.
