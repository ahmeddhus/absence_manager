# absence_manager

A Flutter application to manage and display employee absences. It includes features like listing absences with pagination, filtering by type and date, and displaying absence details such as member name, absence type, period, and status. The app supports loading and error states, as well as an empty state when no results are found. Optionally, the app can generate an iCal file for integration with Outlook.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

This project follows clean architecture principles with a layered approach, separating data, domain, and UI concerns. The structure is designed to be modular, scalable, and testable.

The architecture is inspired by the official Flutter team's guidance on scalable app design:  
ðŸ“˜ [Flutter Architecture Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide)

For full implementation details and folder responsibilities, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ðŸ”€ Branch Naming Convention

This project follows a clear and consistent branch naming strategy based on the type of work being done:

| Prefix       | Purpose                              | Example                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `feature/`   | New feature or functionality         | `feature/pagination`               |
| `fix/`       | Bug fix                              | `fix/loading-state`                |
| `chore/`     | Setup, tooling, config, non-feature  | `chore/folder-structure`           |
| `docs/`      | Documentation only                   | `docs/architecture-and-readme`     |
| `refactor/`  | Code cleanup with no behavior change | `refactor/usecase-layer`           |
| `test/`      | Adding or updating tests             | `test/bloc-tests`                  |

> Branch names should be lowercase, use hyphens to separate words, and be as descriptive as possible.
